      summary: Create Hosted Zone
      description: Creates a new public hosted zone, used to specify how the Domain
        Name System (DNS)routes traffic on the Internet for a domain, such as example.com,
        and its subdomains. ImportantPublic hosted zones can't be converted to a private
        hosted zone or vice versa.Instead, create a new hosted zone with the same
        name and create new resource recordsets.Send a POST request to the /2013-04-01/hostedzone
        resource. The request body must include a documentwith a CreateHostedZoneRequest
        element. The response returns theCreateHostedZoneResponse element containing
        metadata about the hostedzone.Fore more information about charges for hosted
        zones, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing.Note the following:You can't create a hosted
        zone for a top-level domain (TLD).Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a
        default SOA record and four NS records for the zone.For more information about
        SOA and NS records, see NS and SOA Records that Amazon Route 53 Creates for
        a Hosted Zone in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.If your domain is registered
        with a registrar other than Amazon Route 53, you must update thename servers
        with your registrar to make Amazon Route 53 your DNS service. For more information,
        seeConfiguring Amazon Route 53 as your DNSService in the Amazon Route 53 Developer's
        Guide.After creating a zone, its initial status is PENDING. This means that
        itis not yet available on all DNS servers. The status of the zone changes
        to INSYNCwhen the NS and SOA records are available on all Amazon Route 53
        DNS servers. When trying to create a hosted zone using a reusable delegation
        set, specify anoptional DelegationSetId, and Amazon Route 53 would assign
        those 4 NS records for the zone, instead ofallotting a new one.

      summary: List Hosted Zones By Name
      description: 'Retrieves a list of your hosted zones in lexicographic order.
        Send a GETrequest to the /2013-04-01/hostedzonesbyname resource. The response
        includes aHostedZones child element for each hosted zone created by the current
        AWSaccount.             ListHostedZonesByName sorts hosted zones by name with
        the labels reversed.For example:                  com.example.www.               Note
        the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some circumstances.If
        the domain name includes escape characters or Punycode,ListHostedZonesByName
        alphabetizes the domain name using the escaped orPunycoded value, which is
        the format that Amazon Route 53 saves in its database. For example, to createa
        hosted zone for example.com, specify ex\344mple.com for the domain name.ListHostedZonesByName
        alphabetizes it as:                  com.ex\344mple.               The labels
        are reversed and alphabetized using the escaped value. For more informationabout
        valid domain name formats, including internationalized domain names, see DNS
        Domain Name Format in theAmazon Route 53 Developer Guide.Amazon Route 53 returns
        up to 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of hosted zones, usethe
        MaxItems parameter to list them in groups of up to 100. The response includesvalues
        that help navigate from one group of MaxItems hosted zones to thenext:The
        DNSName and HostedZoneId elements in the responsecontain the values, if any,
        specified for the dnsname andhostedzoneid parameters in the request that produced
        the currentresponse.The MaxItems element in the response contains the value,
        if any, thatyou specified for the maxitems parameter in the request that produced
        thecurrent response.If the value of IsTruncated in the response is true, there
        are morehosted zones associated with the current AWS account. If IsTruncated
        is false, this response includes the last hosted zonethat is associated with
        the current account. The NextDNSName element andNextHostedZoneId elements
        are omitted from the response.The NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId elements
        in theresponse contain the domain name and the hosted zone ID of the next
        hosted zone that isassociated with the current AWS account. If you want to
        list more hosted zones, makeanother call to ListHostedZonesByName, and specify
        the value ofNextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId in the dnsnameand hostedzoneid
        parameters, respectively.'
